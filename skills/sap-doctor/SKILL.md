# SC4SAP Doctor

Diagnoses the full SC4SAP stack: plugin installation, MCP server status, and live SAP system connectivity. Reports findings with actionable fixes for each issue found.

<Purpose>
sc4sap:sap-doctor runs a structured health check across three layers: the SC4SAP plugin itself, the mcp-abap-adt MCP server registration, and the live SAP system connection. It surfaces problems with clear remediation steps so you can get back to development quickly.
</Purpose>

<Use_When>
- Something isn't working and you're not sure where the problem is
- After initial setup to confirm everything is configured correctly
- After a SAP system change (password reset, IP change, client migration)
- User says "doctor", "diagnose", "check connection", "something's broken", or "is it working"
- MCP tools return errors or are not visible in Claude Code
</Use_When>

<Diagnostic_Checks>
Run all checks in order. Report PASS / FAIL / WARN for each.

**Layer 1 - Plugin Health**
- [ ] SC4SAP plugin directory exists and is readable
- [ ] `package.json` version is current
- [ ] Skill files present (14 skills in `skills/` directory)
- [ ] Config file exists at `.sc4sap/config.json`

**Layer 2 - MCP Server**
- [ ] `mcp-abap-adt` appears in Claude Code MCP server list
- [ ] MCP server process is running (check via tool availability)
- [ ] At least one MCP tool (`GetSession`) responds without error
- [ ] MCP server version is compatible with installed plugin

**Layer 3 - SAP System Connection**
- [ ] `GetSession` returns valid system data (system ID, client, user)
- [ ] `GetInactiveObjects` responds (tests developer authorization)
- [ ] `ListTransports` responds (tests transport authorization S_TRANSPRT)
- [ ] `SearchObject` with a simple query responds (tests object repository access)
- [ ] `GetTableContents` on `T000` responds (tests table access)

**Layer 4 - Configuration**
- [ ] SAP host URL is reachable (HTTPS port)
- [ ] Configured client matches `GetSession` response
- [ ] Configured username matches `GetSession` response
</Diagnostic_Checks>

<Remediation_Routing>
- MCP server missing -> `/sc4sap:mcp-setup`
- SAP connection error -> display connection troubleshooting from `/sc4sap:mcp-setup` Troubleshooting section
- Missing config -> run `/sc4sap:setup` wizard
- Authorization errors -> display required authorization objects (S_DEVELOP, S_TRANSPRT)
- All pass -> "SC4SAP is healthy. System: {SID} Client: {client} User: {user}"
