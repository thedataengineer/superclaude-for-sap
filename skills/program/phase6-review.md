# Phase 6 — Code Review (MANDATORY, Unconditional)

This file is the authoritative checklist for the Phase 6 review step of `/sc4sap:program`. SKILL.md references this file — do not duplicate the content there.

## Purpose

A successful activation from Phase 4 only proves the code **compiles and links**. It does NOT prove the code follows the shared conventions in `../../common/`. Phase 6 closes this gap: the reviewer fetches every created object's source via MCP and verifies, line by line, against each applicable convention file.

> **Past incident** — a spec said "build LVC_T_FCAT manually" → executor faithfully wrote `APPEND ls_fc TO pt_fcat` repeated per column → activation succeeded → user found `alv-rules.md` violation only after manual review. Phase 6 would have caught it before the user ever saw the program.

## Pipeline Position

- Phase 4 (Implementation) → Phase 6 (Review) → Phase 8 (Completion Report)
- Phase 5 (QA) is conditional on OOP mode. Phase 7 (Debug) is conditional on failures. **Phase 6 is unconditional.**
- Phase 8 has a hard gate: it requires `review.md` to exist with PASS verdicts before the report can be written.

## Agent

Delegate to `sap-code-reviewer`. Pass:
- The list of object names created in Phase 4 (with type: PROG/I, PROG/P, DYNP, CUAD, etc.)
- The transport number
- The path to `spec.md`
- A reminder to write the review log to `.sc4sap/program/{PROG}/review.md`

## Convention Checklist

For each created object, fetch source via the appropriate MCP tool (`GetInclude`, `GetProgram`, `GetClass`, `GetInterface`, `GetScreen`, `GetGuiStatus`, `GetTextElement`) and verify against **every** convention below that applies. Record verdict per check: `PASS` / `FIX-APPLIED` / `N/A (reason)`.

### 1. `../../common/alv-rules.md` — ALV Display Rules

Applies to: any program that displays a result set in ALV.

- [ ] **Display mode** matches the spec: `CL_GUI_ALV_GRID` for full screens (custom screen + GUI status + Docking Container), `CL_SALV_TABLE` for popups
- [ ] **Container** for full ALV is `CL_GUI_DOCKING_CONTAINER` (NOT custom container in a Custom Control screen element)
- [ ] **Field Catalog Construction Standard (CRITICAL — most-often violated)**:
  - The catalog MUST be extracted via SALV factory and converted with `cl_salv_controller_metadata=>get_lvc_fieldcatalog`. See `alv-rules.md` Step 1 for the canonical FORM signature.
  - **VIOLATION pattern to flag**: any code that builds `LVC_T_FCAT` by repeated `CLEAR ls_fc / ls_fc-fieldname = ... / APPEND ls_fc TO pt_fcat`. This bypasses DDIC reference resolution and duplicates type metadata that SALV would derive automatically.
  - Per-field attribute adjustment (`coltext`, `outputlen`, `do_sum`, `no_out`, `hotspot`, `qfieldname`, `cfieldname`) must use a `CASE FIELDNAME` block on the extracted catalog, never inline construction.

### 2. `../../common/text-element-rule.md` — Text Element Rule

Applies to: every screen, every dialog message, every literal that the end user can see.

- [ ] No hardcoded display literals in screen layouts — all field labels reference `TEXT-Txx`
- [ ] No hardcoded literals in `MESSAGE` statements that aren't dynamic — short labels go through text elements (`MESSAGE TEXT-t01 TYPE 'E'`)
- [ ] Translatable strings are NOT embedded in string templates with literal text only (`|자재 { lv } 생성|` — the static parts should still come from text elements when reused)
- [ ] Text elements are created via `CreateTextElement` and present after activation

### 3. `../../common/constant-rule.md` — Constant Rule

Applies to: every program with logic.

- [ ] No magic literals in business logic — function codes (`'SAVE'`, `'EXIT'`), status names, screen numbers used in branching, threshold values must be `CONSTANTS` declared in the TOP include
- [ ] `gc_fcode_*` (or equivalent prefix) constants are referenced everywhere the literal would otherwise appear
- [ ] System values like `abap_true` / `abap_false` / `space` used instead of `'X'` / `''` / `' '`

### 4. `../../common/procedural-form-naming.md` — Procedural FORM Naming (Procedural mode only)

Applies to: programs implemented with PERFORM (not OOP local classes).

- [ ] Every FORM that handles screen-bound logic ends with the screen number suffix (`_0100`, `_0200`)
- [ ] FORMs shared across screens get no suffix (utility helpers)
- [ ] PBO/PAI module names follow `STATUS_xxxx` / `USER_COMMAND_xxxx` style

### 5. `../../common/oop-pattern.md` — OOP Two-Class Pattern (OOP mode only)

Applies to: programs implemented with local classes.

- [ ] Two classes present: `LCL_DATA` (BAPI/business logic) + `LCL_SCREEN` or `LCL_ALV` (presentation)
- [ ] No business logic in screen class, no UI calls in data class
- [ ] Public method surface is minimal; helpers are PRIVATE

### 6. `../../common/include-structure.md` — Include Structure

Applies to: every multi-include program.

- [ ] Suffix convention followed: `_TOP` / `_SEL` / `_CLASS` / `_PBO` / `_PAI` / `_FORM` / `_TST` (and `_O` / `_I` / `_F` legacy variants if the project uses them)
- [ ] Empty-by-design includes are NOT created; conditional includes (e.g., `_SEL` for a no-parameter program) are simply omitted, not stubbed
- [ ] TOP include holds all global TYPES / DATA / CONSTANTS — no DATA declarations leaking into PBO/PAI/FORM

### 7. `../../common/naming-conventions.md` — Naming Conventions

Applies to: every created object.

- [ ] Z/Y prefix on all custom objects
- [ ] Module prefix in program / table / class names where the convention prescribes (e.g., `ZMM*` for MM, `ZSD*` for SD)
- [ ] Include names match `{PROG}_{SUFFIX}` exactly
- [ ] Function group / function module / data element / domain naming follows the table in the convention

### 8. `../../common/clean-code.md` — Clean ABAP

Applies to: all generated source.

- [ ] No `SELECT *` — explicit field list
- [ ] No `SELECT` inside `LOOP` — use `FOR ALL ENTRIES` or join
- [ ] `SY-SUBRC` checked after every statement that sets it (SELECT SINGLE, READ TABLE, CALL FUNCTION with EXCEPTIONS)
- [ ] Inline declarations (`DATA(...)`, `FIELD-SYMBOL(<...>)`) used where appropriate
- [ ] Modern syntax (`VALUE #()`, `COND`, `SWITCH`, `REDUCE`, `FOR ... IN`, string templates) used when `ABAP_RELEASE` permits — do NOT emit syntax newer than the configured release
- [ ] No commented-out code, no debug statements (`BREAK-POINT`, `MESSAGE 'TEST'`)

### 9. `../../common/abap-release-reference.md` — ABAP Release Awareness

- [ ] No syntax used that exceeds the configured `abapRelease` (e.g., no `RAP managed implementation` on a 740 system)

### 10. `../../common/sap-version-reference.md` — SAP Version Awareness

- [ ] No S/4-only tables/APIs on ECC (`MATDOC`, `ACDOCA`, `BUT000` for BP)
- [ ] No ECC-deprecated patterns on S/4 (e.g., `LFA1`/`KNA1` directly when BP is the master record)

### 11. `../../common/spro-lookup.md` — SPRO Lookup Protocol

Applies to: programs that depend on SPRO/IMG configuration.

- [ ] Customizing tables referenced in code match what `sap-{module}-consultant` recommended in `consult-{module}.md`
- [ ] No hardcoded org-unit values that should come from customizing

### 12. Activation State

- [ ] `GetInactiveObjects` returns 0 entries from the program's object set
- [ ] All objects assigned to the agreed transport request

## Violations Fixed In-Phase

For each FIX-APPLIED entry: object name, line excerpt, what was changed, why.

## Final Verdict

✅ ALL PASS — proceed to Phase 8
or
❌ BLOCKED — list residual violations and reason
```

## Failure Handling

- On any violation: the reviewer **fixes the violation directly** via `Update*` MCP tools and re-activates. Documentation-only flagging is NOT acceptable.
- After all fixes, re-fetch sources and re-verify. Loop until ALL PASS or 3 iterations exhausted.
- If 3 iterations exhausted with residual violations: STOP, write `review.md` with `❌ BLOCKED`, surface to user with the specific violation list. Phase 8 is blocked.
