# Phase 3.5 — Execution Mode Gate

Authoritative rule for the execution-mode selection that runs **between Phase 3 (spec approval) and Phase 4 (implementation)** in `/sc4sap:create-program`. Referenced from `agent-pipeline.md` and `SKILL.md`.

## Pipeline Position

```
Phase 1 ([trust-session bootstrap] → Interview) → … → Phase 3 (Spec) → [Spec Approval Gate] → Phase 3.5 (this file) → Phase 4 …
```

Phase 3.5 runs AFTER `spec.md` receives the explicit approval keyword, BEFORE any `Create*` / `Update*` MCP call of Phase 4.

**Note**: `trust-session` is NOT invoked here — it is invoked at the very start of Phase 1A so that even interview-time MCP calls (consultant SPRO lookups, `GetWhereUsed`, `SearchObject`) run without permission prompts. By the time Phase 3.5 runs, session trust is already in place.

## Steps

### Step 1 — Mode Selection Prompt

Display this verbatim to the user:

```
✅ Spec approved. Select execution mode:

  [1] auto    — Phase 4–8 runs unattended (recommended for simple CRUD/Report)
                 └ only pauses on error or Phase 6 BLOCKED verdict
  [2] manual  — prompts "proceed to Phase N?" at every phase transition
                 └ tool permission prompts already suppressed (trust-session active)
  [3] hybrid  — Phase 4 (implementation) runs auto; Phase 5–8 prompt per phase

Choice: 1 / 2 / 3  (default: 2)
```

### Step 2 — Persist Selection

Write the selection to `.sc4sap/program/{PROG}/state.json` under `execution_mode`. Also log phase timestamps here (see C-2 schema below).

### Step 3 — Mode Semantics

| Mode | Phase 4 | Phase 5 | Phase 6 | Phase 7 | Phase 8 | Tool prompt |
|------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
| `auto` | run | run | run | run on fail | run | suppressed |
| `manual` | prompt before | prompt before | prompt before | prompt before | prompt before | suppressed |
| `hybrid` | run | prompt before | prompt before | prompt before | prompt before | suppressed |

**In ALL modes, permission prompts for MCP tools are suppressed** via `trust-session` (bootstrapped at Phase 1A). The prompt the user sees in `manual` / `hybrid` is ONLY the phase-transition confirmation — never a tool approval.

### Step 4 — Manual-Mode Prompt Format

Between phases in `manual` or `hybrid`, display:

```
✓ Phase {N-1} complete — {1-line summary}

Proceed to Phase {N}?
  [y] proceed   [s] skip (conditional phases only)   [a] abort — save state and exit
```

- `y` / Enter: run the next phase
- `s`: valid only for conditional phases — Phase 5 (testing scope = none) or Phase 7 (no failures). Required phases re-prompt.
- `a`: record the current phase in `state.json` and exit. The next run resumes from this phase.

## State.json Schema (C-2: Resume Support)

```json
{
  "prog": "ZFI_...",
  "execution_mode": "auto | manual | hybrid",
  "phases": {
    "0_preflight":   { "status": "completed", "ts": "2026-04-18T10:00:00Z" },
    "1a_interview":  { "status": "completed", "ts": "..." },
    "1b_interview":  { "status": "completed", "ts": "..." },
    "2_planning":    { "status": "completed", "ts": "..." },
    "3_spec":        { "status": "completed", "ts": "...", "approved_at": "..." },
    "3_5_mode_gate": { "status": "completed", "ts": "..." },
    "4_implement":   { "status": "in_progress | completed | blocked", "ts": "..." },
    "5_qa":          { "status": "skipped | completed | blocked", "ts": "..." },
    "6_review":      { "status": "completed | blocked", "ts": "..." },
    "7_debug":       { "status": "skipped | completed", "ts": "..." },
    "8_report":      { "status": "completed", "ts": "..." }
  },
  "objects_created": [ "..." ],
  "transport": "S4HK904224"
}
```

## Resume Behavior

On next `/sc4sap:create-program` invocation with the same `{PROG}`:
1. If `state.json` exists and has `execution_mode` set, skip Phase 0–3.5 re-prompting.
2. Find the first phase with `status != "completed" && status != "skipped"` — resume from there.
3. If user wants to restart a completed phase, they must delete the corresponding entry manually.

## Enforcement Contract

- Phase 4 Executor MUST refuse to run if `state.json.phases.3_5_mode_gate.status != "completed"`.
- If user picked `auto` and a phase transition happens, the skill MUST NOT prompt — a prompt is a bug.
- If user picked `manual` / `hybrid`, the skill MUST NOT auto-proceed — missing the confirmation is a bug.
- `trust-session` activation is always required regardless of mode.
