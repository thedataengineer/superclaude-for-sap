description: Analyze a CBO (Customer Business Object) package — discover frequently-used Z tables / function modules / data elements / classes / structures / table types — and save a per-module / per-package reference file so later `program` / `program-to-spec` runs prefer existing CBO elements over new ones.

# SC4SAP Analyze CBO Objects

Walks a CBO (Customer Business Object) package, inventories every project-built ABAP element (table, structure, data element, class, interface, function module, program, view, table type), detects which elements are **frequently reused inside the package**, infers each element's business purpose from its name/fields/descriptions, and persists the result to `.sc4sap/cbo/<MODULE>/<PACKAGE>/` for downstream skills (`program`, `program-to-spec`, `create-object`, `autopilot`) to consult before creating anything new.

<Main_Thread_Dispatch>
Apply [`../../common/main-thread-dispatch.md`](../../common/main-thread-dispatch.md) with **target model = `sonnet`** (matches this skill's frontmatter `model:`).

**Nested exception**: if invoked with `parent_skill=<name>` argument, execute inline — skip sub-dispatch.

**Interactive mitigation**: pass `name="analyze-cbo-obj-runner"` to the `Agent()` call and use `SendMessage` for module/package selection and the optional Logic-heavy briefing decision.

**Nested phase dispatches**: the Sonnet orchestrator delegates the heavy walk to `sap-stocker` (Sonnet), optionally to `sap-writer` (Haiku) for rich briefing — 3-level chains from main.
</Main_Thread_Dispatch>

<Purpose>
Projects accumulate Z tables, Z data elements, Z function modules, and ZCL_ classes that encode domain logic. New development too often recreates near-duplicates because nobody has a compact inventory of what already exists. `analyze-cbo-obj` produces that inventory — once per package — and writes it to a file that later `sc4sap:` skills read automatically, so the next spec / program / object creation defaults to reusing proven CBO assets.
</Purpose>

<Response_Prefix>
Every response triggered by this skill MUST begin with `[Model: <main-model> · Dispatched: <sub-summary>]` per [`../../common/model-routing-rule.md`](../../common/model-routing-rule.md) § Response Prefix Convention.
</Response_Prefix>

<Phase_Banner>
Multi-phase skill. Before each `Agent(...)` dispatch, emit `▶ phase=<id> (<label>) · agent=<name> · model=<Opus 4.7|Sonnet 4.6|Haiku 4.5>` per [`../../common/model-routing-rule.md`](../../common/model-routing-rule.md) § Phase Banner Convention.
</Phase_Banner>

<Use_When>
- Starting development on a module that already has a sizeable Z-package
- Onboarding onto an AMS / support engagement (need a map of custom assets)
- Before `/sc4sap:create-program` or `/sc4sap:create-object` on a new spec — so reuse is evaluated
- User says "analyze CBO", "analyze custom objects", "map Z package", "list frequently used customs", "CBO inventory"
</Use_When>

<Do_Not_Use_When>
- User wants a code quality review of one object → `/sc4sap:analyze-code`
- User wants to reverse-engineer ONE program into a spec → `/sc4sap:program-to-spec`
- User wants to create an object → `/sc4sap:create-object`
- Package does not yet contain custom objects (CBO discovery is not meaningful)
</Do_Not_Use_When>

<Session_Trust_Bootstrap>
**MANDATORY — runs as Step 0 before any MCP call or user interaction.**

Invoke `/sc4sap:trust-session` with `parent_skill=sc4sap:analyze-cbo-obj` to pre-grant all MCP tool + file-op permissions for this session (eliminates per-tool "Allow this tool?" prompts during the 8-step walk).

- If `.sc4sap/session-trust.log` already has a line within the last 24h, skip silently.
- Otherwise run it and surface the one-line confirmation.
- All subsequent `Agent` dispatches within this skill MUST pass `mode: "dontAsk"`.

Full spec: see [`../trust-session/SKILL.md`](../trust-session/SKILL.md).
</Session_Trust_Bootstrap>

<Workflow_Steps>
Orchestration is **3 main-thread Socratic steps (Haiku) + one delegated dispatch to `sap-stocker` (Sonnet) + a branching hand-off**. Detailed spec lives in [`workflow-steps.md`](./workflow-steps.md).

- **Step 1 / 1.5 / 2 (main thread · Haiku)** — Socratic intake: package name → flagship programs (optional `<KEY_PROGRAMS>`) → module. Frontmatter `model: haiku` pins the main thread to Haiku 4.5 for cost-efficient Q&A — no domain judgment required for intake.
- **Step 3–7 (delegated · Sonnet 4.6)** — One `Agent(...)` dispatch to `sap-stocker`. The stocker runs its own Investigation_Protocol: walk → `GetWhereUsed` graph → pin/frequency tiering → business-purpose inference → cross-module gap analysis (per [`../../common/active-modules.md`](../../common/active-modules.md)) → sensitive-name flagging → persist `index.md` + `inventory.json` → return a `Logic-heavy: <bool>` flag. Authoritative spec: [`../../agents/sap-stocker.md`](../../agents/sap-stocker.md) § Investigation_Protocol + § Output_Format.
- **Step 8 (branching)**:
  - **Branch A** (`Logic-heavy: false`, DDIC-dominant) — canned summary printed by main thread (Haiku). No agent dispatch.
  - **Branch B** (`Logic-heavy: true`, FM/CLAS/INTF/large-PROG in inventory) — dispatch `sap-writer` (Haiku 4.5) for a reader-facing briefing: pinned highlights · business-logic assets · cross-module gaps · sensitive objects · next-step hint. Writer BLOCKED → fallback to Branch A.

Main thread NEVER calls `GetPackageContents` / `GetWhereUsed` itself for the inventory pass — that context stays inside the stocker so the orchestrator window remains small even for large packages (200+ objects).

<MCP_Tools_Used>
- Discovery: `GetPackage`, `GetPackageContents`, `GetPackageTree`, `SearchObject`, `GetObjectsByType`
- Object detail: `GetTable`, `GetStructure`, `GetDataElement`, `GetDomain`, `GetView`, `GetClass`, `GetInterface`, `GetFunctionGroup`, `GetFunctionModule`, `GetProgram`, `GetObjectInfo`
- Usage graph: `GetWhereUsed`
- NEVER used by this skill: `GetTableContents`, `GetSqlQuery` (no row data — DDIC metadata only)
</MCP_Tools_Used>

<Related_Skills>
- `/sc4sap:create-program` — reads `.sc4sap/cbo/<MODULE>/<PACKAGE>/inventory.json` during spec drafting to prefer existing CBO elements
- `/sc4sap:program-to-spec` — same, for reverse-engineering
- `/sc4sap:create-object` — same, to suggest reuse before creation
- `/sc4sap:analyze-code` — quality review of ONE object (complementary, not overlapping)
</Related_Skills>

<Data_Extraction_Safety>
This skill only reads DDIC metadata and where-used relations. It MUST NOT call `GetTableContents` or `GetSqlQuery`. Row-level access stays behind the standard blocklist + `acknowledge_risk` gate. See `common/data-extraction-policy.md`.
