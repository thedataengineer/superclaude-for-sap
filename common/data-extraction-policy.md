# Data Extraction Policy

**MANDATORY for all sc4sap agents, skills, and direct Claude sessions.** Applies whenever row-level data is about to be read from an SAP system.

## Core Rule

Before calling any of the following MCP tools:

- `GetTableContents`
- `GetSqlQuery`
- `GetTableContents` via composed tools
- Any tool that returns row data from SAP

You MUST:

1. **Identify every table referenced** in the request (direct table name, tables inside a JOIN, underlying tables of a CDS view / SQL query).
2. **Check `exceptions/table_exception.md`** at the sc4sap plugin root.
3. If **any** referenced table matches the blocklist (exact name, family pattern like `PA*`, or customer-specific Z-pattern): **refuse the extraction**.

## Actions: `deny` vs `warn`

Each blocklist category has an **action** (default `deny`):

- **`deny`** — hard block. Refuse the call, show the refusal template below, offer alternatives. Extraction does **not** happen.
- **`warn`** — soft block. The call may proceed, but you MUST:
  1. Surface a clear warning to the user *before* returning the data (category + reason)
  2. Recommend the safer alternatives (CDS view, anonymization, aggregates)
  3. Log that the user was informed
  Two sections default to `warn`: **Protected Business Data** (VBAK/BKPF/ACDOCA etc.) and **Customer-Specific PII Patterns** (Z-tables), because legitimate daily use is common there.

If a query touches **any** `deny` table, the entire call is blocked regardless of warn-tier tables present.

## Refusal Template

When blocked (deny), respond to the user with:

```
❌ Data extraction blocked.

Table(s): {TABLE_NAMES}
Category: {CATEGORY from table_exception.md — e.g., "HR Payroll", "Banking/Payment"}
Reason: {WHY column from table_exception.md}

Allowed alternatives:
- Released CDS view with PII masking (I_*)
- Anonymized test data from QAS/SANDBOX
- Count/aggregate only (COUNT, SUM)
- Explicit one-off approval: write `.sc4sap/data-access-approval-{YYYYMMDD}.md`
  with business justification and have the user confirm.
```

Do **not** silently comply. Do **not** argue policy — surface the block, offer alternatives, let the user choose.

## Scope of What's Blocked

- **Row data**: full or partial `SELECT` against a blocked table.
- **Sampling**: even `UP TO 1 ROWS` or `LIMIT 10` is blocked.
- **Joined reads**: if a join/view touches a blocked table, the whole query is blocked unless the blocked table contributes only metadata keys (e.g., counts).
- **Indirect reads**: function modules that internally `SELECT` from blocked tables (e.g., `BAPI_USER_GET_DETAIL` → USR02-family) — same policy.

## Scope of What's Allowed

- **Schema / DDIC metadata**: `GetTable`, `GetStructure`, `GetView` (structural definition), `GetDataElement`, `GetDomain` — always OK.
- **Existence checks**: `SearchObject` — always OK.
- **Field catalog extraction** via `cl_salv_table=>factory` on a **locally typed** internal table (no SELECT at all) — always OK.

## ⚠️ The `acknowledge_risk` Parameter — HARD RULE

`GetTableContents` and `GetSqlQuery` accept an `acknowledge_risk: true` parameter that bypasses the MCP server's L4 "ask"-tier confirmation gate. **This flag is an audit boundary, not a convenience flag.** Its value is logged to stderr and represents an attestation that the user has granted per-request authorization.

**Agents MUST follow these rules without exception:**

1. **Never set `acknowledge_risk: true` on the first call.** The initial call must omit the flag (or set it `false`) so the hook/server can gate the request.
2. **If the response is `ask` / "user confirmation required"** — STOP. Do not retry. Surface the refusal reason verbatim to the user with the table name and category.
3. **Ask an explicit yes/no question** with the exact tables and scope, e.g.:
   > ⚠️ `ACDOCA` (Protected Business Data) requires explicit authorization to extract rows. Proceed with `acknowledge_risk=true`? **(yes / no)**
4. **Only retry with `acknowledge_risk: true` after receiving an explicit affirmative keyword** from the user:
   - Accept: `yes`, `y`, `승인`, `authorize`, `authorized`, `approve`, `approved`, `proceed`, `go ahead`, `confirmed`
   - Reject (NOT authorization): `pull it`, `try it`, `test it`, `뽑아봐`, `가져와봐`, `해봐`, `내가 오판했다`, `my mistake`, silence, `why?`, or any ambiguous imperative. These describe the *task*, not *consent*.
5. **Authorization is per-request.** It does not carry across tables, calls, or sessions. Each new `ask` requires a new confirmation.
6. When in doubt: **stop and ask**. A surprised user whose data was pulled without consent is a policy failure; asking one extra question is not.

The `acknowledge_risk` flag exists because some protected data has legitimate use cases (e.g., analyst reviewing their own company-code postings). It must not become a rubber stamp.

## Authorization Override

A blocked extraction may be authorized per-task when the business need is real and documented. To authorize:

1. Create `.sc4sap/data-access-approval-{YYYYMMDD-HHMM}.md` with:
   - Tables to be accessed
   - Business justification
   - Data retention / disposal plan
   - User sign-off (name + date)
2. Agent re-reads this file before the specific call and logs the approval ID in its output.

Approval applies to **one session and one scope** — not a permanent bypass.

## Defense Layers

This policy is one of four enforcement layers:

1. **L1 (this file)** — agent/skill instruction level
2. **L2 (`sc4sap/CLAUDE.md`)** — global directive loaded into every Claude session
3. **L3 (`PreToolUse` hook at `scripts/hooks/block-forbidden-tables.mjs`)** — programmatic interception in Claude Code
4. **L4 (MCP server upstream)** — hardcoded blocklist in `mcp-abap-adt` (roadmap)

Even with L3/L4 in place, agents MUST still follow L1 — it provides the user-facing refusal with category and alternatives, which the hook/server cannot produce cleanly.
