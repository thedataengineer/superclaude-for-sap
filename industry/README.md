# Industry Reference

This folder holds per-industry business-characteristic references that SAP consultant agents MUST consult when performing **configuration analysis, process design, Fit-Gap analysis, master data modeling, or requirement interpretation**.

## When to Use

Every `sap-*-consultant` agent must load the project's industry file before responding to:

- SPRO / Customizing analysis (org structure, pricing, output, account determination, etc.)
- Business process design or review
- Fit-Gap analysis
- Master data modeling
- Ambiguous requirements that require domain judgement
- SAP Industry Solution (IS-*) applicability decisions

## How to Identify Industry

Resolution order:
1. `.prism/config.json` → `industry` field (canonical plugin-side source)
2. `.prism/sap.env` → `SAP_INDUSTRY` (MCP-server mirror, must match config.json)
3. If both are missing, ask the user and direct them to persist via `/prism:sap-option`
4. If the value is `other`, skip the industry reference and fall back to standard, industry-agnostic recommendations

**Change industry**: `/prism:sap-option` → type `industry` (updates both files atomically).
**Initial selection**: `/prism:setup` wizard, step 2.

```markdown
1. Receive request
2. Identify industry (config.json → sap.env → ask user)
3. Load `industry/{industry}.md`
4. Apply "Key Processes", "Master Data", "Common Customizations" sections to the configuration analysis
5. Explicitly warn when a proposed standard configuration conflicts with an industry characteristic
```

## File Structure

Each industry MD file contains the following sections:
- **Business Characteristics** — defining traits of the industry
- **Key Processes** — core business processes
- **Master Data Specifics** — master data peculiarities
- **Module Implications** — SD / MM / PP / FI / CO / WM / etc. implications
- **Common Customizations** — frequently required enhancements
- **SAP Industry Solutions** — relevant SAP IS offerings
- **Pitfalls / Anti-patterns** — patterns to avoid
